1. About This Plugin			*dubs-after-dark-about*

This plugin provides an opinionated negative polarity color scheme.

The highlights are mostly Vim defaults, with a few tweaks to
improve contrast, provoke vibrancy, and increase readability.

Basically, if you clear highlights and start fresh, e.g.,:

  highlight clear
  colorscheme default " I (landonb) think this is same as :hi clear.
  set background=dark
  set termguicolors
  highlight Normal gui=NONE guifg=White guibg=#060606 ctermfg=White ctermbg=none

This plugin makes the following tweaks:

- Searches (i.e., started with `/`, `*`, or Dubs' `<F1>`)
  are highlighted with a light pink background and underline.

- Spelling mistakes are highlight in XXX with an undercurl.

- The `ColorColumn` is set to light grey.

- The background is set to almost black, #060606, which you can
  easily override by setting `g:dubs_after_dark_background`
  before loading the color.

- And more! Your best bet is to install the plugin, load the color,
  and see if you like it.

  `:color after-dark`

The Dubs After Dark color works well the compelling
`Dubs Appearance <https://github.com/landonb/dubs_appearance>`__`
plugin, which adjusts other parts of the look and feel of Vim.
<Shameless self-plug.>

For another excellent light-on-dark (though not black) color scheme,
