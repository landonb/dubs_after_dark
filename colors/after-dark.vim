  "   colors should be in the range 0-15!
  "     For now I'll comment out lines and prefix with "TERM:" if just

  " When you start a search (e.g., with /), IncSearch is the color used to
  " highlight the next match after the cursor as you type (until you hit
  " return, and then all matches are highlighted according to Search).
  "
  " IncSearch is also the color used to highlight the current match of a
  " find-and-replace (sub-replace-special) command, e.g., when you run:
  "
  "   :.,$s/foo/bar/gc
  "
  " The default is the reverse of the Search highlight, but this doesn't
  " always look the best.
  "
  " 2017-12-09: I tried white on black, as an alternative to reverse:
  "
  "   highlight IncSearch term=reverse guifg=#000000 guibg=#FFFFFF gui=underline ctermfg=0 ctermbg=6 cterm=underline
  "
  " but reverse, reverse, reverse -- the default -- still looks better:
  "
  "   highlight IncSearch term=reverse cterm=reverse gui=reverse
  "
  " 2018-05-08: I haven't been happy with using the reverse of Search. When
  " the base color foreground is similar to the Search color background,
  " then IncSearch's reverse makes the highlight look very much like the
  " Search highlight -- and it's near impossible to discern which text the
  " sub-replace-special command is asking confirmation on.
  "
  " For example, open a reST file and find-replace text found in an
  " unformatted section (what follows a double-colon :: indicator).
  " The text, highlighted per rstLiteralBlock, is already kind of
  " orangey yellow. And the after-dark Search highlight (currently)
  " is black on yellow. So the find-replace IncSearch highlight, when
  " reverse, looks almost exactly like Search, and one cannot easily
  " (quickly) tell the difference.
  "
  " A simple solution is to add standout (bold) and italic:
  "
  "   highlight IncSearch term=reverse,standout,italic cterm=reverse,standout,italic gui=reverse,standout,italic
  "
  " Note that there's also 'bold' (which looks same as standout to me),
  " and even 'strikethrough', but 'strikethrough' looks craze.
  "
  " Wanna test? Clear first, e.g.,:
  "
  "   hi clear IncSearch
  "   highlight IncSearch ctermbg=233 ctermfg=228 guifg=#F2ED7F guibg=#1C1C1C gui=standout,italic
  "   hi clear IncSearch
  "   highlight IncSearch ctermbg=233 ctermfg=228 guifg=#F2ED7F guibg=#D46A6A gui=standout,italic
  "
  " Anyway, I think I'll try a red background for now, because it pops better
  " than reverse for more highlights, I think, and I don't think there's much
  " that's red except for the Error highlight.
  "
  " See also, for shades of red:

  " 2017-12-09: The Search highlight is ridiculously hard to get right.

  " 2021-02-15: Only took a decade, but finally using Vimdiff, at least
  "             by way of vim-mergetool (by way of `git mergetool`):
  "
  "               https://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool
  "
  "             And that's when I realized after-dark's Diff* highlights
  "             were way too difficult to read!
  "
  " - Here are the historical after-dark Diff* highlights, which are
  "   fairly close to the default Vim highlights:
  "
  "     highlight DiffAdd term=bold ctermbg=4 guibg=DarkBlue
  "     highlight DiffChange term=bold ctermbg=5 guibg=DarkMagenta
  "     highlight DiffDelete term=bold ctermfg=12 ctermbg=6 gui=bold guifg=Blue guibg=DarkCyan
  "     highlight DiffText term=reverse cterm=bold ctermbg=9 gui=bold guibg=Red
  "
  "   - Note that it's really the DiffText guibg=Red and not setting the
  "     foreground that makes it hard to read. (I'm not sure if there's a
  "     default foreground color being used, or if the particular foreground
  "     for each token is applied, but either way it looks bad. We need to
  "     be deliberate about the foreground color.)
  "
  " - But this colorscheme was not the only one with poor Diff highlights.
  "
  " - I demoed a number of colorschemes from flazz:
  "
  "     https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes/tree/master/colors
  "
  "   and the majority that I tested used similarly difficult to read
  "   red backgrounds for diff highlights. (Though I didn't test a large
  "   enough sample size to infer that it's a widespread problem, just
  "   that of the (very) few colorschemes that I did test, the Diff
  "   highlight colors did not seem like something that was necessarily
  "   customized for the colorschemes (indeed, how many Vimmers also
  "   vimdiff? it feels like a niche).)
  "
  " - Of the ten or twenty colorschemes that I did test, these four
  "   looked the radest:
  "
  "     triplejelly, understated, vorange, and zazen.
  "
  "   But I liked zazen the best, so I copied its Diff* highlights.
  "
  " - The following highlights are from zazen (thanks, zazen!):

  " 2020-07-21: (lb): I'm tired on the gross orangy literal block color,
  " because I use literal blocks for quoting articles a lot. A green
  " color is much easier to read and more pleasant to view.

  "     hi def link rstLiteralBlock                 String
  "   where
  "     SynLink String		Constant
  "   and Constant is defined in this file as #ffa0a0.

  " 2017-11-12: Weird. In the terminal ctermbg=Black or =0 is same as =DarkGray/DarkGrey.
  "   But using 8 gets us black... or any number not negative or 0-7....
  "   Also, ctermbg=none works.
  " Set the background, e.g.,
  "   highlight Normal gui=NONE guifg=White guibg=#060606 ctermfg=White ctermbg=none
  exe 'highlight Normal gui=NONE '
    \ 'guifg=White guibg=#' . g:dubs_after_dark_background
