About This Plugin
-----------------

This plugin provides an opinionated negative polarity color scheme.

The highlights are mostly Vim defaults, with a few tweaks to
improve contrast, provoke vibrancy, and increase readability.

Basically, if you clear highlights and start fresh, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: vim

  highlight clear
  set background=dark
  set termguicolors
  highlight Normal gui=NONE guifg=White guibg=#060606 ctermfg=White ctermbg=none

This plugin makes the following tweaks:

- Searches (i.e., started with ``/``, ``*``, or Dubs' ``<F1>``)
  are highlighted with a light pink background and underline.

- Spelling mistakes are highlighted with a light grey background
  and a red undercurl.

- The ``ColorColumn`` is set to light grey.

- The background is set to almost black, #060606, which you can
  easily override by setting ``g:dubs_after_dark_background``
  before loading the color.

- And more! Your best bet is to install the plugin, load the color,
  and see if you like it.::

  :color after-dark

The Dubs After Dark color works well the compelling
`Dubs Appearance <https://github.com/landonb/dubs_appearance>`__
plugin, which adjusts other parts of the look and feel of Vim.
<Shameless self-plug.>
